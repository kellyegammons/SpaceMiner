# SpaceMiner
A simple game of mining ore and making money.

## about
This is an item collection game that uses asynchronous tasks to mine ore, collect ore, sell ore,
and refuel a finite resource. I wrote this to get more familiar with UI, recycleviews, datasources,
and asynctasks. This game can be scaled to add crafting and other activities.

Ore mining revolves around comparing a the modulus of a random integer and another integer, which
determines how likely the ore is to occur. For example, Gold ore is less likely to appear than
Iron ore.
